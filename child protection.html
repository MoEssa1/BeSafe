                    <h1>Child Protection</h1>
                    <p> Child protection, also known as safeguarding, is a fundamental aspect of the welfare system in
                        the United Kingdom, aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of children and young people. It
                        encompasses a range of measures designed to prevent and respond to abuse, neglect, exploitation,
                        and other forms of harm.
                        In the UK, child protection is governed by both legislation and comprehensive safeguarding
                        policies and procedures. The Children Act 1989 and the Children Act 2004 provide the legal
                        framework for child protection, emphasizing the paramount importance of the child's welfare and
                        the duty of care owed to them by parents, caregivers, and the state.</p>
